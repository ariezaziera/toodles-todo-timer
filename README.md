🎯 Why I Made This
I noticed Python is super in-demand nowadays —
As a penganggur (currently job-seeking 😎), I decided to explore Python by myself and create this second project.
It's a small project, but meaningful to me while sharpening my skills!

1. Clone this repo:

🔥 Future Improvement
Might convert into a Flask web app next time...
But for now, happy with the cozy desktop version 😌
